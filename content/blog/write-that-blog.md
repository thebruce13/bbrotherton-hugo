I've tried to write blogs for a long time with a myriad of attempts over at Blogger.com. Each one abandoned to sit until the end of time. Each one with a handful of posts about nothing in particular. I knew that if I was going to blog at all it was going to be on my own website and it needed to be with a webpage I didn't build from scratch. 

So I made this website my blog and I love that my content isn't managed by anyone - I have all the files and can write about whatever I want. Though I don't write anything really off the wall - having my corner of the web being <span style="text-transform: uppercase">my</span> corner helps. I can write these off-topic pieces about life and am not fully devoted to CSS and website topics.
