I've tried to write blogs for a long time with a myriad of attempts over at Blogger.com. Each one abandoned to sit until the end of time. Each one with a handful of posts about nothing in particular. I knew that if I was going to blog at all it was going to be on my own website and it needed to be with a webpage I didn't build from scratch.
