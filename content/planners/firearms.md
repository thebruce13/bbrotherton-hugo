  A planner that lets you track your mood as a firearm featuring:

  A mood tracker where you pick what gun you feel like in the morning. Anyone who has played Call of Duty or used a firearm knows the temperament of a UZI verses a Sniper.

  An energy tracker so you can see what your at from day to day.

  A gratitude log to keep your head on straight

  A bullsh*t tracker so you can keep tabs on what your boss needs you to do today.

  A time tracker in case you have something that needs to get taken care of at a specific time.

  A water tracker so you keep yourself in top performance

  A caffeine tracker, because you are a responsible man and won't consume more than 400mg of caffeine in a day and keep your heart healthy.

  A high-five tracker because, if it doesn't sting a little it doesn't count.
